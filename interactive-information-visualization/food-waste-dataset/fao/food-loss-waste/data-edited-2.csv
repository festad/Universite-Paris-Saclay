A semi structured  questionnaire aimed at investigating some rice farmer’s perception  about postharvest losses of rice was administered to thirty rice  farmers in “Besease” a rice farming community in the Ashanti  region of Ghana. Information on farmers’ perception of postharvest  losses and methods of reducing such losses was collected. Other  important information collected included the causes of postharvest  losses, the estimation of postharvest losses.  Field experiment  Two rice varieties, Nerica 1 and Nerica 2, commonly grown by  farmers were grown for assessment. For each variety, an area of 4  x 5 m was demarcated for cultivation. There were three replications  per variety. Cultural practices carried out on the field included land  clearing, ploughing, retovation, raising nursery for seedlings and  transplanting. At maturity the crops were, harvested, threshed,  dried, stored and milled to determine the postharvest losses that  were involved at each stage.

288,Ghana,,0113,Rice,2011,32.855,13.01 -52.7,,Milling,Processing,,"The results of the milling analysis have been presented in  Table 6. The results showed that SB30 had marginally  higher milling yield (67.32%) than SB10 (66%).  However, the differences between the milling yields of  either the SB30 machine and the locally manufactured  milling machine or that of the SB10 machine and the  locally manufactured milling machine were significant.  The locally manufactured milling machine had the lowest  milling yield (63.33%). This implies that the locally  manufactured milling machine was less efficient as it also  resulted in higher percentage (52.7%) of broken grains  (Table 6). This implies that the local machine produced  less white rice per unit weight of paddy. This resulted in  less recoverable rice and therefore less revenue. SB30 is therefore superior to both SB10 and the Local machine in  terms of milling yield. In spite of the higher milling yield of  SB30, it is still lower than the 67.5% (2010 data)  considered to the lowest on record in the USA (Robinson,  2010). According to the author, this could lead to a shift  to selling more broken grains, consequently mean lower  prices. Norman and Otoo (2003) recommended that  improved dehulling and whitening machines should be  developed and tested for use in rice processing","Table 7.

Weight losses during storage losses of Nerica 1 and Nerica 2.      The research was conducted at Nobewam and Besease in the  Ejisu-Juabeng District in the Ashanti Region of Ghana between  2009 and 2010.  Survey  The survey on farmers’ perception and knowledge of postharvest  losses of rice was conducted at Besease in the Ejisu Juabeng  District of the Ashanti Region of Ghana. A semi structured  questionnaire aimed at investigating some rice farmer’s perception  about postharvest losses of rice was administered to thirty rice  farmers in “Besease” a rice farming community in the Ashanti  region of Ghana. Information on farmers’ perception of postharvest  losses and methods of reducing such losses was collected. Other  important information collected included the causes of postharvest  losses, the estimation of postharvest losses.  Field experiment  Two rice varieties, Nerica 1 and Nerica 2, commonly grown by  farmers were grown for assessment. For each variety, an area of 4  x 5 m was demarcated for cultivation. There were three replications  per variety. Cultural practices carried out on the field included land  clearing, ploughing, retovation, raising nursery for seedlings and  transplanting. At maturity the crops were, harvested, threshed,  dried, stored and milled to determine the postharvest losses that  were involved at each stage.  Experimental design  A 2 x 2 RCBD was used comprising 2 varieties (Nerica 1 and Nerica  2) and 2 harvesting methods (panicle and sickle) for determining  harvesting losses. The experimental design for milling yield was 2 x  3 CRD comprising 2 varieties and 3 milling machines.",Controlled Experiment,"Appiah F1*, Guisse R1 and Dartey P. K.

Total losses due to  only harvesting and threshing losses at farmer’s fields  ranged between 5.60 and 16.14%. The differences in  postharvest losses among the farmers were due to  different level of skill of harvesting and threshing as well  as poor weed control. During the study it was observed  that the farmers’ fields were engulfed in a lot of weeds.  Poor weed control is known to interfere with effectiveness  of harvesting (Al-Khatib, 1995).",5,Case Study,"Appiah F1*, Guisse R1 and Dartey P. K.

Usually, no collective bargaining takes place on the price because each  farmer interacts individually with traders (brokers) and as a result, traders take advantage of  farmers by colluding to buy mangoes at prices lower than the prevailing market prices. This  exploitative tendency by buyers who offer very low prices was mentioned by 94 percent of farmers  as the major marketing challenge followed by delayed purchase after harvest (64%). This occurs  when brokers instruct farmers to harvest the mangoes promising to pick them up the next day but   41  then intentionally delay to do so. They then persuade farmers to sell their produce at lower prices  to avoid additional spoilage and loss given that mangoes are highly perishable. On-farm sorting,  grading and bulking of mango fruit is a common practice and is usually done by traders (brokers)  before buying them. They bring their own workers to the farm to harvest the fruit or by giving a  purchasing future date thus advising farmers on when to harvest. In both cases, the buyer meets the  labour costs involved. After sorting, damaged mangoes are rejected by buyers and farmers usually  have to find alternative use or ways to dispose the fruits. Those rejected because of fruit fly  infestation are buried in a deep hole.  The lack of good storage facilities at the farm level was also a major challenge that compelled  54 percent of farmers to sell their mangoes on the day of harvesting. Others (46%) kept them under a  makeshift shed to minimize sunburn, loss of moisture and accumulation of dust for a few days as  they waited to sell. In addition, most access roads to farms are passable only during the dry seasons  of the year but if there are heavy rains during the harvesting period, accessibility is impeded thus  contributing to post-harvest losses and a deterioration of quality leading to low selling prices. When  farmers were asked to rank the attributes that buyers considered as the most important when  selecting mangoes for purchase, 96 percent ranked fruit size first, followed closely by quality (92%),  colour as a maturity indicator (80%) and mango variety (42%). These results reveal the importance  of quality as a key attribute of marketable fruit. It is a compound attribute that refers to the lack of  external or internal damage or injury caused by insect pests, diseases, birds or mechanical damage.",The model was estimated using data collected from 240 mango growing farmers selected using multistage and proportionate to size random sampling procedures.,Survey,MUCHIRI CAROLINE MUGURE; MSc Thesis_Caroline Muchiri.pdf,,"The clustered distribution of the economic loss indicates that 36 percent of mango  farmers suffered produce losses of less than 10 percent while 8 percent of farmers suffered losses  of more than 40 percent via rejections during harvest. From the study, the mean percentage fruit  loss was found to be 24 percent with some farmers experiencing losses of up to 60 percent. The  mean percentage loss for farmers who intercropped (24.4%) was not very different from that  suffered by those who monocropped (23.1%)"

(2007) compared the performance of reaper with  conventional method of manual harvesting of wheat crop with sickle to see the feasibility. They  recorded 5.8% to 11.8% harvesting losses with reaper.,,Literature Review,Sukhbiret al. (2007),,"According to a most conservative estimate, about 10% of the  cereals harvested in developing countries are lost annually (Chaudhry, 1982). Most of the Pakistani  scientists strongly believe that 10% post-harvest losses of wheat are not at all uncommon in our  country (Ahmad et al., 1992). The wheat grain losses are classified as i) pre-harvest grain loss due to  the birds, rodents and environmental; ii) harvest grain loss during harvesting of the crop; and iii) postharvest grain loss due to bundling, transporting, threshing and winnowing.  Muhammad Sattar et al. “Grain Losses of Wheat as Affected by Different Harvesting and Threshing  Techniques”    Harvesting losses with manual wheat harvesting varied from 3 to 7% after ripening of the crop  (Iqbalet al., 1980). Similarly Ibupotoet al. (1991) investigated that average grain losses for traditional  methods during pre-harvest, harvest and post harvest stages were 10.9, 29 and 122.9 kg ha-1  or 0.28%,  0.77% and 3.28%, respectively whereas, Zafarullah (1985) observed 2.1% total manual harvesting  losses. Singh et al. (1988) tested three tractor front mounted reapers, manufactured locally by FMI,  AMRI and Ittefaq on wheat crop in Pakistan. The wheat grain losses with these reapers were 1.19,  2.63 and 2.76%, respectively. Sukhbiret al. (2007) compared the performance of reaper with  conventional method of manual harvesting of wheat crop with sickle to see the feasibility. They  recorded 5.8% to 11.8% harvesting losses with reaper. Basavarajaet al. (2007) concluded that grain  losses during harvesting and threshing activity of wheat were 0.36 kg/q and 0.44 kg/q, respectively.  Bukhariet al. (1983) found that the average grain losses during conventional harvesting, bundling,  transporting, threshing, winnowing and cleaning were 3.67, 3.98, 0.24, 1.18, 2.46, and 4.53%,  respectively    Chaudhry (1979) estimated 2.01 and 1.2% grain  losses on account of tractor threshing and combine, respectively. The combine harvester not only  minimizes the post-harvest losses but also helps in shortening the harvesting period. Shamabadi  (2012) while evaluating the performance of eight combines observed that time of harvesting, seed  moisture content, relative humidity, field topography and varietal characteristics are the major factors  affecting harvest losses. He concluded that mean total loss by different combines was 6.88% at wheat  harvesting stage. Mirasi et al. (2013) measured grain losses of different wheat varieties with different  models of combine during harvest stage. They observed that average pre harvest losses in all fields of  study were 31.4 kg ha-1  accounting for 12.71 percent of total losses. Bala et al. (1980) also reported  4.09% grain losses of wheat by traditional methods of harvesting and threshing. AMRI (1987) found  2.2% wheat losses for combine as compared to 4.65% for reapers and about 7.5% for manual  harvesting. Begum et al. (2012) found 0.51 kg/quintal grain losses of wheat during the threshing  activity. They concluded that threshing losses were mainly in the form of broken grains. They  observed 2.35 kg/quintal post-harvest losses at farm level. The harvesting losses have added up to  about 40.85 per cent.    .

Quantitative post-harvest losses of economic importance occur  in the field (15%); during processing (13e20%), and during storage (15e25%). The main storage pests  responsible for the losses are larger grain borers (Prostephanus truncatus), grain weevils (Sitophilus  granarius) and, the lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica). Most of the farmers considered changes in  weather (40%), field damage (33%), and storage pests (16%) as the three most important factors causing  poor crop yields and aggravating food losses. However, survey results suggest that the farmers’ poor  knowledge and skills on post-harvest management are largely responsible for the food losses. 77% of the  surveyed farmers reported inadequate household foods and 41% received food aid during the previous  year. Increasing farmers’ technical know-how on adaptation of the farming systems to climate variability,  and training on post-harvest management could reduce food losses, and improve poverty and household  food security",97,Survey,"Adebayo B.
